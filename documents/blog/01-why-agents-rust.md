# Why Agents, Why Rust, and What “Fast” Really Means

## What you’ll learn
- The minimum viable responsibilities of an agent system
- Latency/recall/cost budgets that shape design
- Why Rust for predictable performance and control

## Outline
- Problem framing and constraints (sub-100ms warm retrieval, deterministic replay)
- Non-goals and scope boundaries
- Budgeting: tokens, latency, dollars; cost-of-pass as a north star
- Local-first bias and pluggable services

*"We are the lucky ones." – Sarena Lin, Bayer Board of Management.*

That was one of [Sarena Lin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarenalin/)'s powerful messages she shared at a recent Bayer town hall addressing the rise of anti-Asian violence in the US. It was also the one that resonated with me the most and made me think and reflect.

2021 marks the 20th year since I first came to the US and my first anniversary of being a US citizen. I still vividly remember my nervousness and excitement twenty years ago when the plane was touching down. Now, those fresh emotions have long faded. However, one remains – I am still incredibly grateful for the opportunities the US has given me, even at a time when the anti-Asian violence is rising across the country.

Why do I pick such a sensitive time to express my appreciation, you might wonder? Let me explain.

Our Asian colleagues and allies are rightfully standing up and advocating against racial violence. At the same time, we are encountering comments both online and in real life that we've heard often before "The US is one of the least racist countries, why complain?", "If it is so bad, why stay here?"

Usually, my better judgment tells me to ignore comments with such classic [straw man fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man). On second thought, I feel it is an excellent opportunity to reach out and create a middle ground for more conversation, understanding, and maybe, even support.

If there is one thing I've learned at this point of my life, after spending an equal amount of time across the Pacific Ocean, the world is not distinctly black and white. To me, It's a complex gradient of grey. Many seemingly conflicting ideologies and realities can co-exist and do co-exist. Yes, there are racial injustices in our society, and yes, the US has put forward a lot in dealing with racism and promoting inclusion and diversity. Both statements can be factual at the same time. I love the US, and I want to make it even better. I appreciate what I have today, and I want to help more people feel the same way.

Living in the US or having a supportive employer such as Bayer makes some of us the lucky ones. And that means we can and must do more, both as individuals and as a society.

So how can we make more of us the "lucky ones"? I believe one way is to keep listening and have an open mind. Even it can be emotionally painful at times. We have to reach out to others, and inclusiveness starts from within.

Have you asked your friends or co-workers what struggles they have had or are having today? Have you taken a moment to learn about a culture or perspective you are not familiar with before? These are all steps I am taking now, and I hope you join me on this journey.
